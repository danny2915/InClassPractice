## Import Data

1. Import the package `tidyverse`, which contains several useful functions for data wrangling and visualization.

2. Create a folder on your computer to store the dataset downloaded from NTU COOL or OpenIntro website.  
   Set your working directory as that folder and import the datasets `county.csv` and `loan50.csv`.

## Scatter Plot

1. Use `county.csv` to draw the scatter plot of `unemployment_rate` (x-axis) and `per_capita_income` (y-axis).

**Hint:** You donâ€™t need to specify any parameter in `geom_point()`.

2. Draw the same graph again, but this time make the following adjustments:

   - adjust the point color to `lightcoral`
   - adjust the point size to `0.5`
   
## Histogram

Use `loan.csv` data to draw the histogram of `loan_amount` (set as x-axis), and adjust the parameter `binwidth` in `geom_histogram()` to 5000.
